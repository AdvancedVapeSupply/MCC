Attempting to reset device into bootloader mode...
=== Reset Device ===
Command: esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port "/dev/cu.usbmodem1101" --before default_reset --after no_reset chip_id
Output:

Serial port /dev/cu.usbmodem1101
Connecting.........................

A serial exception error occurred: Could not configure port: (6, 'Device not configured')
Note: This error originates from pySerial. It is likely not a problem with esptool, but with the hardware connection or drivers.
